        <p>This fried egg taco idea is all the rage on TikTok right now and with good reason. It's fast to make and actually very delicious. There are many variations of the recipe, but I thought it was important to walk through the “hack” and discuss why it's a successful recipe and also give a sure-fire version you can make at home.</p>
        <p>While there are some versions of this taco made in an air fryer, I actually prefer to make it in a standard skillet (either nonstick, cast iron, or stainless steel) so the tortilla gets super crispy with direct contact to the skillet.</p>
        <p>You can use any pan for these tacos. If you are worried about the tacos sticking, you can use a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron skillet. The most difficult skillet to use for these fried egg tacos is probably the stainless steel skillet, which is what I tried for my version. The stainless steel does great at making the tortilla super crispy, but if some egg or cheese gets off the tortilla, it can stick a bit to the skillet which makes for a more difficult clean up.</p>
        <p>To make sure the corn tortillas get super crispy on the outside, start them well before you add the eggs. Add a drizzle of oil to the skillet over medium heat and once the skillet is hot, add the tortillas. Let them cook for about 10 seconds and then flip them just to get both sides coated with a little oil. Now let them sit for 4-5 minutes in the skillet, getting nicely charred on the bottom. If you don't do this, your egg will be overcooked by the time your tortilla is crispy or your tortilla will be soggy, which isn't great.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 (6-inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cheddar cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salsa, for garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 avocado, thinly sliced, for garnish</li>
            <li>Cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and coat the pan. Then add the corn tortillas. Let them cook for 10 seconds, then flip. Let tortillas cook alone in the pan for 4-5 minutes until they are starting to get brown on the bottom and crispy.</li>
            <li>Carefully crack an egg on top of each tortilla in the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook for two minutes. Remove the lid and add cheese around the eggs. Some will probably get on the skillet and that's okay but try to keep most of it on the tortillas. Add one tablespoon of water to the skillet, cover, and cook for another 60-90 seconds. The tacos are ready when the cheese is melted and the eggs are set but the yolks are still slightly runny.</li>
            <li>OUse a good spatula to remove each taco from the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and top with salsa, avocado, and cilantro. Serve immediately while warm!</li>
