# odin-recipes
Good day, my name is Mykhailo. I am The Odin Project student.
By doing this project I learned:
1) A structure of a simple web page
2) How to put internal and external links to a web page
3) How to put images and also learned their atributes
4) How to use lists
5) How to git add, clone, commit and push. Basicaly I did all the thing using terminal and VS, except when I needed to save info and images from the web
6) How bad I want to try Chicago style pizza. This week, I will make it 100%
7) How much I enjoyed doing it. And there is so much to do once I learn more. I am really excited

Thank you, The Odin Project!
